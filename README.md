# Restaurant Parallax Website
This project is a responsive, one-page parallax website for a restaurant. It is designed to showcase the restaurant's services, menu, and booking options. The website also works offline, ensuring that users can access it without an internet connection.

## Overview
This website features:
- A parallax background effect with sections for Home, About Us, Menu, Booking, and Contact.
- A simple, clean design with responsive layouts for various screen sizes.
- A booking form to reserve a table at the restaurant.
- 
## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Works on all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
- **Parallax Scrolling:** Gives a dynamic, engaging effect as users scroll.
- **Offline Access:** Allows users to view the website even without an internet connection.
-**Booking Form:** Customers can book a table online by filling out a form.

  ## Service Workers

Service Workers are scripts that run in the background of a web application, separate from the web page itself. They enable features like:
- **Offline Access**: Service Workers can cache application resources, allowing the app to function without an internet connection. This means users can still access the booking system even when offline.
- **Improved Performance**: By caching assets and resources, Service Workers can speed up load times, providing a smoother user experience.
- **Background Sync**: This feature allows your application to defer actions until the user has a stable internet connection. For example, if a user books a table while offline, the booking can be processed when the connection is restored.
